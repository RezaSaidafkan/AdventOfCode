* its beneficial to use Pydantic models for parsing text, you can construct your model and validate the parsing easier. 
* its super nice to use `Rich` library for printing matrices & parsing data
* this problem's design was very smart! at first it lures you into creating a map table. but this approach is terrible on big inputs. so you have to convert it into runtime conversion functions.
* I've kept the map table functions in the code as well.
